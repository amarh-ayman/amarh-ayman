#Hi 🤗
<br><br>
## About Me

Hello! I'm Amarah Bishtawi, a passionate frontend and backend developer with a strong focus on creating engaging and user-friendly web applications. I have 2 years of experience in the field and enjoy building robust and scalable solutions.

### Frontend Development

In frontend development, I specialize in HTML, CSS, SCSS, Liquid JS, jQuery and JavaScript. I have a deep understanding of modern frontend frameworks like React and Angular, and I'm proficient in using tools such as Webpack and Babel to optimize the development process. I strive to create clean and efficient code while ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.

### Backend Development

On the backend, I have expertise in working with popular programming languages like Python and JavaScript (Node.js). I am experienced in designing and developing RESTful APIs and have a good understanding of databases, including SQL and NoSQL. I'm familiar with frameworks like Express.js and Django, which enable me to create powerful and efficient server-side applications.

### Full-Stack Proficiency

Being a full-stack developer, I excel in bridging the gap between frontend and backend technologies. I have hands-on experience in integrating frontend interfaces with backend functionality, ensuring seamless communication and data flow. This allows me to build end-to-end solutions that meet both user requirements and technical specifications.

### Problem Solving and Collaboration

I am a strong problem solver and enjoy tackling complex challenges. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices. I am also an effective communicator and enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions.


If you're interested in working together or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always eager to connect with like-minded developers and explore new opportunities.

Happy coding!
